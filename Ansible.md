**Inventory parameters for a local connection in Ansible:** To establish a local connection instead of using SSH, you can set the `ansible_connection` parameter to `local` in your inventory file. This is commonly used when you are running Ansible on the same machine that you are managing.

Example inventory:

`localhost ansible_connection=local`

This tells Ansible to manage the local machine (localhost) without using SSH, since it can directly execute tasks on the local machine.

**Value for `ansible_connection` to connect to a Windows server:** To connect to a Windows server, you need to set the `ansible_connection` parameter to `winrm`. Ansible uses Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to communicate with Windows hosts.

Example inventory for connecting to a Windows machine:

`[windows] winserver ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=Administrator ansible_password=your_password ansible_connection=winrm ansible_port=5986 ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore`

In this example:

- `ansible_connection=winrm` specifies that Ansible will use WinRM to connect.
- `ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore` is used to ignore certificate validation for secure connections (you can configure this based on your setup).
